# Dragon Dungeon #

## Version 0.0.0 ##

### Introduction ###

Dragon Dungeon is a very simple game that can best be described as
"cat and mouse" in style. You play a dragon who has mysteriously woken
up in a dungeon/ancient ruins. Your goal is to escape the dungeon by
activating the switches that open the exit. The Golems who protected the
dungeon will attack you on sight and your only defence is a slowly
regenerating pool of fire breath. Use it wisely. The Golems, once killed,
won't stay dead forever.

### Requirements ###

For running the game, the only requirement is Java 1.7.0 minimum.

For compiling the game, the requirements are:

* Java JDK 1.7.0+
* JSFML Test Release 5
* Google GSON
